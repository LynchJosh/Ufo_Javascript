# Ufo_Javascript



##	Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project was to take a data set on UFO sightings and make a simple interface where users could filter key characteristics for the data array. A Javascript app was made to grab data from the data.js file and filters were created to make it easier for a user to find relevant information.  



##	Results
With filters, users can search for key characteristics.
- Enter Date
- Enter a City
- Enter a State
- Enter a Country
- Enter a Shape

###	Example below on the filters working
To use the filters, simply enter in one of the filter fields what you would like to search for and click enter.

##	Summary: 
The one drawback I see right off the bat is there is no range for the dates filter. Having a range could be crucial to find a pattern in reports between neighbouring towns.   

The First recommendation - Having a filter that could count how many ufo sightings per city 

The second recommendation - Having a filter that could search for keywords under the comments column
